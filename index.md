**I am a workshop facilitator and writer. I design and lead workshops that enable participants to explore their feelings, desires, and emotions in relation to broader social and political contexts.**

**Some examples of workshops I've led are:**

* <a href="https://festival.antiuniversity.org/event/$8Yfobg5XStkIUuuiCme1G_adLSoasuJB7DsFzcRf-Zg" target="_blank">Feel Tank: On Ambivalence, Dissatisfaction and Disappointment</a> as part of AntiUniversity Festival 2025
* Critical Hedonism(s): On the Politics of Desire at <a href="https://www.altshiftfestival.org/" target="_blank">Alt Shift Festival 2025</a>
* Queering Happiness as part of the Queer Utopias reading group at the London Night Cafe 

My workshop facilitation is informed by an interest in disability and accessibility. I recently co-designed an immersive digital accessibility workshop for LSE staff and academics at the Eden Centre for Education Enhancement, and previously worked as a Campaigners Office at the Royal National Institute of Blind People where I ran a series of team workshops on understanding sight loss through an intersectional lens.

During my time at the RNIB, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rnib_charityawards-activity-7216801218373791747-wYgI" target="_blank">my team was awarded</a> The Charity Awards 'Campaigning and Advocacy Award' and I spoke on <a href="https://audioboom.com/posts/8152520-join-unlocking-equality-by-changing-behaviours-an-rnib-panel-discussion-event-and-help-to-cha" target="_blank">RNIB Connect Radio</a> about behaviour change in attitudes towards sight loss.
