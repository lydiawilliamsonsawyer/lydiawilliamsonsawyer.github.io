## Current interests

My main interest is in the intersection between feelings and broader social and political conditions, see [projects page](https://lydiawsawyer.com/projects/). This is an interest which has led me in many directions, including:

**Spirituality and Buddhism**. I have spent time living in Buddhist communities and organised retreats with the Triratna Buddhist community on meditation and ecology. In 2024, I was involved in setting up a "Transforming Self and World" group at the London Buddhist Centre which involves regular public events to discuss the applicability of Buddhist teachings to current social and political issues.  

**Digital technologies**. I am interested in the processes through which discourses of optimisation, efficiency, and productivity are culturally mobilised to justify harmful and high-risk technological developments. I have recently written about [the dangers of transitioning to a digital cashless economy](https://thebeaverlse.co.uk/what-are-the-costs-of-a-cashless-future/). 

**Alternative, non-institutional learning**. I am passionate about accessible, participatory, and non-hierarchical forms of education. I engage with this interest through working at Kairos Counter-Club and as a member of the organising committee for AntiUniversity.

**Disability justice**. I recently co-designed an immersive digital accessibility workshop for LSE staff and academics at the Eden Centre for Education Enhancement, and ran a series of workshops on understanding sight loss through an intersectional lens in my previous role as Campaigns Officer at the Royal National Institute of Blind People.

**Community living**. I am drawn to alternative forms of community living and have lived and volunteered at various communities, co-housing projects, and ecovillages in the UK and Europe. The use of non-violent communication in communities is a particular interest.

If you share any of these interests, feel free to email me as I enjoy talking and hearing other people's perspectives.
