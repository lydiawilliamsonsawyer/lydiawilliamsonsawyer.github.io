I am a workshop facilitator and writer. I design and lead workshops for participants to explore their feelings, desires, and emotions in relation to social and political contexts.

## Some examples of workshops I've led are:

* <a href="https://festival.antiuniversity.org/event/$8Yfobg5XStkIUuuiCme1G_adLSoasuJB7DsFzcRf-Zg" target="_blank">Feel Tank: On Ambivalence, Dissatisfaction and Disappointment</a> as part of AntiUniversity Festival 2025
* Critical Hedonism(s): On the Politics of Desire at <a href="https://www.altshiftfestival.org/" target="_blank">Alt Shift Festival 2025</a>
* Queering Happiness as part of the Queer Utopias reading group at the London Night Cafe 2025

My workshop facilitation is informed by an interest in disability and accessibility. I recently co-designed an immersive digital accessibility workshop for LSE staff and academics at the Eden Centre for Education Enhancement, and previously worked as a Campaigns Office at the Royal National Institute of Blind People where I ran a series of team workshops on understanding sight loss through an intersectional lens.

## Current interests

My main interest is in the intersection between feelings and broader social and political conditions. This is an interest which has led me in many directions, including:

**Spirituality and Buddhism**. I have spent time living in Buddhist communities and organised retreats with the Triratna Buddhist community on meditation and ecology. In 2024, I was involved in setting up a "Transforming Self and World" group at the London Buddhist Centre which involves regular public events to discuss the applicability of Buddhist teachings to current social and political issues.

**Digital technologies**. I am interested in the processes through which discourses of optimisation, efficiency, and producitivty are culturally mobilised to justify harmful and high-risk technological developments. I have recently written about the dangers of transitioning to a digital cashless economy for the LSE student newspaper, [forthcoming Jan 26].

**Alternative, non-institutional learning**. I am passionate about accessible, participatory, and non-hierarchical forms of education. I engage with this interest through working at Kairos Counter-Club and as a member of the organising committee for AntiUniversity.

**Community living**. I am drawn to alternative forms of community living and have lived and volunteered at various communities, co-housing projects, and ecovillages in the UK and Europe. The role of Nonviolent Communication for building and sustaining communities is a particular interest.

Books that significantly impacted me: Cruel Optimism by Lauren Berlant; Ways of Being by James Bridle; Mushroom at the End of the World by Anna Tsing; The Promise of Happiness by Sara Ahmed; Post-Growth Living: For an Alternative Hedonism by Kate Soper; Emma Goldman’s essays (various); When Things Fall Apart by Pema Chodron; Minor Detail by Adania Shibli
