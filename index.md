**I am a workshop facilitator and writer. I design and lead workshops that enable participants to explore their feelings, desires, and emotions in relation to broader social and political contexts.**

## Some examples of workshops I’ve led are:

* Feel Tank: On Ambivalence, Dissatisfaction and Disappointment as part of AntiUniversity Festival 2025
* Critical Hedonism(s): On the Politics of Desire at Alt Shift Festival 2025
* Queering Happiness as part of the Queer Utopias reading group at the London Night Cafe 

My workshop facilitation is informed by an interest in disability and accessibility. I recently co-designed an immersive digital accessibility workshop for LSE staff and academics at the Eden Centre for Education Enhancement, and previously worked as a Campaigners Office at the Royal National Institute of Blind People where I ran a series of team workshops on understanding sight loss through an intersectional lens.

During my time at the RNIB, my team was awarded The Charity Awards ‘Campaigning and Advocacy Award’ and I spoke on RNIB Connect Radio about behaviour change in attitudes towards sight loss.

## Other interests

I am also interested in digital surveillance, writing can be found here, and ….

Spirituality and Buddhism in the contemporary age, writing here, and have organised retreats around ecology and meditation.

Beyond this I work at XX and am on the organising committee for AntiUniversity.
