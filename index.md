**I am a workshop facilitator and writer. I design and lead workshops for participants to explore their feelings, desires, and emotions in relation to  social and political contexts.**

**Some examples of workshops I've led are:**

* Queering Happiness as part of the Queer Utopias reading group at the London Night Cafe 2025

My workshop facilitation is informed by an interest in disability and accessibility. I recently co-designed an immersive digital accessibility workshop for LSE staff and academics at the Eden Centre for Education Enhancement, and previously worked as a Campaigners Office at the Royal National Institute of Blind People where I ran a series of team workshops on understanding sight loss through an intersectional lens.

**Current interests**

My main interest in the intersection between how we feel and broader social and political conditions. This an interest which has led me in many directions, including:

Spirtuality and Buddhism. I have spent time living in Buddhist communities and organised retreats with the Triratna Buddhist community on meditation and Deep Ecology. In 2024 I was involved in setting up a group titled "Transforming Self and World" at the London Buddhist Centre which meets regularly to discuss the applicability of Buddhist teachings to current social and political issues.

Digital technologies. I am increasing concerning about the development of AI systems and the transformation of increasing areas of our lives from analogue to digital technologies. I have recently written about the dangers of digital cashless economies for my student newspaper, [forthcoming 28 Jan 26].

Non-institutional learning. I am drawn to accessible non-institutional and non-hierarchical forms of learning and education. I engage this interest through working at Kairos Counter-Club and as a member of the organising committee for AntiUniversity.

Community living. I feel skeptical of individualised housing set-ups and have spent time living and working at various communities and ecovillages in the UK and Europe.
