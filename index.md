I am a workshop facilitator and writer. I design and lead workshops for participants to explore their feelings, desires, and emotions in relation to social and political contexts.

My workshop facilitation is informed by an interest in disability and accessibility. I recently co-designed an immersive digital accessibility workshop for LSE staff and academics at the Eden Centre for Education Enhancement, and previously worked as a Campaigns Officer at the Royal National Institute of Blind People where I ran a series of team workshops on understanding sight loss through an intersectional lens.

## Current interests

My main interest is in the intersection between feelings and broader social and political conditions, see [projects page](https://lydiawsawyer.com/projects/). This is an interest which has led me in many directions, including:

**Spirituality and Buddhism**. I have spent time living in Buddhist communities and organised retreats with the Triratna Buddhist community on meditation and ecology. In 2024, I was involved in setting up a "Transforming Self and World" group at the London Buddhist Centre which involves regular public events to discuss the applicability of Buddhist teachings to current social and political issues.  

I am currently exploring what Rosi Braidotti has termed as the postsecular turn in feminism. I am interested in the contemporary resurgence and digital mediation of spiritual discourses amongst young women in a UK context, where conventional fantasies of the 'good life' are increasingly untenable. I am keen to explore why it is that White, middle-class spiritual practices are often framed as empowering and liberating, whilst racialised religious practices continue to be positioned as incompatible with modernity.

**Digital technologies**. I am interested in the processes through which discourses of optimisation, efficiency, and productivity are culturally mobilised to justify harmful and high-risk technological developments. I have recently written about the dangers of transitioning to a digital cashless economy for the LSE student newspaper, [forthcoming Jan 2026].

**Alternative, non-institutional learning**. I am passionate about accessible, participatory, and non-hierarchical forms of education. I engage with this interest through working at Kairos Counter-Club and as a member of the organising committee for AntiUniversity.

**Community living**. I am drawn to alternative forms of community living and have lived and volunteered at various communities, co-housing projects, and ecovillages in the UK and Europe. The role of Nonviolent Communication for building and sustaining communities is a particular interest.
