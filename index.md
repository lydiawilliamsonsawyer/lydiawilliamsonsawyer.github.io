I am a workshop facilitator and writer. I design and lead workshops for participants to explore their feelings, desires, and emotions in relation to social and political contexts.

## Some examples of workshops I've led are:

* <a href="https://festival.antiuniversity.org/event/$8Yfobg5XStkIUuuiCme1G_adLSoasuJB7DsFzcRf-Zg" target="_blank">Feel Tank: On Ambivalence, Dissatisfaction and Disappointment</a> as part of AntiUniversity Festival 2025
* Critical Hedonism(s): On the Politics of Desire at <a href="https://www.altshiftfestival.org/" target="_blank">Alt Shift Festival 2025</a>
* Queering Happiness as part of the Queer Utopias reading group at the London Night Cafe 2025

My workshop facilitation is informed by an interest in disability and accessibility. I recently co-designed an immersive digital accessibility workshop for LSE staff and academics at the Eden Centre for Education Enhancement, and previously worked as a Campaigners Office at the Royal National Institute of Blind People where I ran a series of team workshops on understanding sight loss through an intersectional lens.

## Current interests

My main interest is in the intersection between how we feel and broader social and political conditions. This is an interest which has led me in many directions, including:

Spirituality and Buddhism. I have spent time living in Buddhist communities and organised retreats with the Triratna Buddhist community on meditation and Deep Ecology. In 2024 I was involved in setting up a group called "Transforming Self and World" at the London Buddhist Centre which involves regular public events to discuss the applicability of Buddhist teachings to current social and political issues.

Digital technologies. I am increasingly concerned about the development of AI systems and the impact this has on our emotional and affective states. I have recently written about the dangers of moving to a digital cashless economy for my student newspaper at LSE, [forthcoming 28 Jan 26].

Alternative, non-institutional learning. I am drawn to non-institutional and non-hierarchical forms of learning and education. I engage with this interest through working at Kairos Counter-Club and as a member of the organising committee for AntiUniversity.

Community living. I feel sceptical of dominant private housing models and have spent time living and working at various communities, co-housing projects, and ecovillages in the UK and Europe.
