**I am a workshop facilitator and writer. I design and lead workshops for participants to explore their feelings, desires, and emotions in relation to  social and political contexts.**

**Some examples of workshops I've led are:**

* <a href="https://festival.antiuniversity.org/event/$8Yfobg5XStkIUuuiCme1G_adLSoasuJB7DsFzcRf-Zg" target="_blank">Feel Tank: On Ambivalence, Dissatisfaction and Disappointment</a> as part of AntiUniversity Festival 2025
* Critical Hedonism(s): On the Politics of Desire at <a href="https://www.altshiftfestival.org/" target="_blank">Alt Shift Festival 2025</a>
* Queering Happiness as part of the Queer Utopias reading group at the London Night Cafe 

My workshop facilitation is informed by an interest in disability and accessibility. I recently co-designed an immersive digital accessibility workshop for LSE staff and academics at the Eden Centre for Education Enhancement, and previously worked as a Campaigners Office at the Royal National Institute of Blind People where I ran a series of team workshops on understanding sight loss through an intersectional lens.

**Other interests**

I am also interested in digital surveillance, writing can be found here [forthcoming].

Alongside this, I am drawn to spirituality and Buddhism, and have organised retreats around ecology and meditation.

I am also engaged in alternative non-institutional forms of learning and education, working at Kairos Counter-Club and on the organising committee for AntiUniversity.

Another interest is community living, and I have spent time living and volunteering in communities across the UK and Europe.
