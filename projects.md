**Wired Feelings**

Ongoing project to explore:

How are our feelings mediated through algorithmically structured digital platforms?
How does this emotional engineering further anti-feminist, authoritarian, and extractive logics?
What happens to social movements when our emotions and feelings are shaped by corporately owned digital technologies?
