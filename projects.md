## Feel Tank

Inspired by [Feel Tank Chicago](https://chronicle.uchicago.edu/071018/political-feeling.shtml), set up in the early 2000s, this project begins from the premise that our feelings, particularly those which may feel difficult to express, are not entirely personal or individual but have a wider social and political significance. 

The Feel Tank is an experiment in reflecting and exploring the complexity, ambivalence, and perhaps nonsensical nature of how we feel. By embracing and expressing feelings which may not otherwise be explored collectively, the aim is to better understand the workings of oppressive systems and position feelings as potential sites for political awareness and collective mobilisation.

I am particularly interested in incongruent feelings - ambivalence, dissatisfaction, disappointment, confusion, uneasiness - which may be subject to individualisation and medicalisation in Western society (e.g. the misleading term 'climate anxiety' which implies feeling fear regarding the climate crisis is the result of an individual's diagnosis of anxiety rather than broader instability and risk). Self-help and therapy may be useful tools for dealing with incongruent feelings, yet can these feelings also be the grounds for social and political transformation?

If you also share this interest, please do email me as I am keen to chat with fellow feel-ers. 

## Wired Feelings

Building on explorations with the Feel Tank form, Wired Feelings applies the consciousness-raising framework to examine our affective entanglements with digital technologies. Critical approaches to digital technology put forth how corporately owned technologies, such as social media platforms, are sites of surveillance, data extraction, and the commodification of user attention. Wired Feelings extends this critique by examining the role of digital technologies in manipulating our feelings, desires, and relationships to ourselves. 

I am keen to explore the following questions through this project:

How are our feelings mediated through algorithmically structured digital platforms?  
What role does this mediation play in broader movements towards tech-authoritarianism? 
What is the impact on digital activism when our emotions and feelings are mediated through corporately owned digital technologies?
