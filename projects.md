**Feel Tank**

"the present is perceived, first, affectively" Lauren Berlant (2011)

Recognise and reflect on how feelings are socially and historically shaped, as opposed to being fixed or purely individual or biological.

On this basis, recognise the socio-political significance of feelings and situate them within broader systems (such as capitalism, patriarchy, white supremacy, heteronormativity).

Create the space to examine the perhaps contradictory, nonsensical, unclear nature of our feelings in the spirit of care, solidarity and imagination.

**Wired Feelings**

Digital platforms do not only exploit our data and time — they shape our feelings, desires, and relationships to ourselves and one another.

How are our feelings mediated through algorithmically structured digital platforms?
How does this emotional engineering further anti-feminist, authoritarian, and extractive logics?
What happens to social movements when our emotions and feelings are shaped by corporately owned digital technologies?
